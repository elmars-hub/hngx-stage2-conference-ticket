# Conference Ticket Generator

A modern React application for generating and managing conference tickets. This project demonstrates the implementation of a multi-step form with data persistence using localStorage.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Multi-step form with progress tracking
- Image upload functionality
- Form data persistence
- Responsive design
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

### Core Technologies

- React
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

### Key React Concepts Used

1. **Hooks**

   - `useState` for managing form data and current page
   - `useEffect` for handling side effects (localStorage updates)
   - `useRef` for file input reference

2. **Components**

   - Functional components with props
   - Component composition
   - Conditional rendering

3. **React Router**
   - Route configuration
   - Navigation between pages
   - Layout components

### Local Storage Implementation

We created a simple storage utility (`src/utils/storage.js`) to handle localStorage operations:

```javascript
const storage = {
  save: function (key, data) {
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(data));
  },

  get: function (key) {
    const item = localStorage.getItem(key);
    return item ? JSON.parse(item) : null;
  },

  remove: function (key) {
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
  },
};
```

This utility is used to:

- Save form progress
- Persist user data between sessions
- Clear data when resetting the form

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling

- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Custom gradients and backgrounds
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Custom fonts integration

## ðŸ“š Key Learning Points

1. **State Management**

   - How to manage complex form state
   - Using localStorage for data persistence
   - State lifting and prop drilling

2. **Form Handling**

   - Multi-step form implementation
   - Form validation
   - File upload handling

3. **localStorage Best Practices**

   - Creating a reusable storage utility
   - JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Error handling for localStorage operations

4. **Component Organization**

   - Separation of concerns
   - Component reusability
   - Props and state management

5. **UI/UX Considerations**
   - Progress indication
   - Form validation feedback
   - Responsive design implementation
